                <h1 class="slide-title">Early Life and the House of Wisdom</h1>
                <p>Born in the region of Khwarizm (modern-day Uzbekistan) around 780 CE, Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was a scholar during the golden age of the Islamic world. His work flourished in Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, where he was a member of the renowned House of Wisdom.</p>
                <p>The House of Wisdom was a major intellectual center, a library, and a translation academy that attracted scholars from across the world. It was here that Al-Khwarizmi worked on his most influential treatises, translating and synthesizing knowledge from Greek, Persian, and Indian sources.</p>

            <div class="slide-content">
                <h1 class="slide-title">Major Contributions</h1>
                <p>Al-Khwarizmi's most significant work, <em>Kitab al-Jabr wa'l-Muqabala</em>, gave the world the discipline of algebra. The word "algebra" is derived from "al-jabr," which means "completion" or "restoration." He provided a systematic method for solving linear and quadratic equations, which was a monumental leap forward in mathematics.</p>
                <p>His book also introduced the Hindu-Arabic numeral system, including the concept of zero, to the Western world. This decimal system with a place value notation replaced the cumbersome Roman numerals and revolutionized mathematics and commerce.</p>
                <p>Finally, his name is the origin of the word <strong>"algorithm"</strong>, which is a key concept for computer science and artificial intelligence. He provided step-by-step procedures for solving mathematical problems, a concept that is the very foundation of modern computing.</p>

                <h1 class="slide-title">From Algorithms to AI</h1>
                <p>The principles laid out by Al-Khwarizmi a millennium ago are the direct precursors to modern computer science and artificial intelligence. An algorithm is a precise, unambiguous set of instructions for solving a problem or performing a calculation. Every piece of software, from a simple calculator to a complex AI model, is built upon algorithms.</p>
                <p>In AI, algorithms are used for everything from machine learning to natural language processing. For example, a machine learning model uses an algorithm to find patterns in data and make predictions, while a sorting algorithm can efficiently organize data for a program. Without Al-Khwarizmiâ€™s foundational work, the development of computer programming and AI would be unimaginable.</p>

                <p>Al-Khwarizmi's contributions have had a profound and lasting impact on the world. His work on algebra provided a powerful new tool for solving problems in science, engineering, and finance. The adoption of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system streamlined mathematics and paved the way for modern accounting and computation.</p>
                <p>Today, as we live in a world driven by technology and data, we are constantly interacting with the legacy of Al-Khwarizmi. From the algorithms that power our search engines to the complex models that enable self-driving cars, his influence is felt in virtually every aspect of our digital lives.</p>
